                            I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/management-science-engineering/">Department of Management Science and Engineering</a>
                            at the University of Waterloo and a faculty affiliate with the <a href="https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca/">Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society</a>
                            . My research looks at how we can use digital trace data created from modern communication platforms to better understand and improve teamwork, by building algorithms to measure complex social phenomena from Management and Engineering literature. I have looked at how we can identify cycles of convergence and divergence within the engineering design process using Topic Modelling. I have analyzed Slack communication using a gender lens, investigating the gendered communication patterns and engagement on these platforms, which was <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3610173">presented at CSCW 2023</a>
                            . In the engineering design space, I have investigated how, why, and when conflict happens in design teams using these platforms, and under what circumstances does it lead to improved innovation. I have studied <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3613905.3650923">Psychological Safety</a>
                            , and am in the process of investigating how we can support teams in building shared understanding. <strong>I am currently recruiting graduate students to work on these projects with me at the University of Waterloo–please reach out if interested.</strong>

                        <p>
                            I completed my Ph.D. in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. I was part of the <a href="https://readylab.mie.utoronto.ca/">Ready Lab</a>
                            led by Dr. Alison Olechowski and I was also a graduate affiliate (and a graduate fellow) with the <a href="https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca/">Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society</a>
                            . My doctoral work was supported by the National Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC). I was formerly a graduate research fellow at the university’s <a href="https://ethics.utoronto.ca/ethics-of-ai-in-context-eaic4e/">Centre for Ethics, Ethics of AI lab</a>
                            from 2021-2022. In summer 2023, I interned on Slack’s Future of Work research team, studying meeting-free weeks and asynchronous attention negotiation. I also worked as a research assistant under Dr. Anastasia Kuzminykh at the <a href="https://www.cookiehci.com/">COoKIE Group</a>
                            investigating explanations human-AI collaboration in subjective decision making. I continue to lead a project investigating student persistence in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I presented the first part of this project at the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Conference in June 2022, and you can see a summary of this work in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBLuq3DTOGA">video form</a>

                        <p>I am passionate about increasing diversity in Engineering, and served as the President of the Graduate Society of Women Engineers in 2022-2023, after serving as the Vice President of Finance from 2021-2022.</p>
                        <p>I hold a Bachelor of Applied Science in Industrial Engineering from the University of Toronto, and have work experience in the energy industry.</p>
