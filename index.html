                            I am a Master of Applied Science (MASc) Candidate in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering (MIE) at the University of Toronto, and a Junior Fellow at <a href="https://www.masseycollege.ca/">Massey College</a>. 
                            I am supervised by Dr. Alison Olechowski of <a href="https://readylab.mie.utoronto.ca/">Ready Lab</a> at the University of Toronto, and mentored by <a href="https://sharonferguson.github.io/cv/">Dr. Sharon Ferguson</a> of SHARE Lab at the University of Waterloo.

                            My research looks at how we can leverage social science methods, such as interviews and surveys, and digital trace data from enterprise communication platforms (e.g., Slack), to support product development teams’ remote and hybrid innovation processes and collaborative behaviors. 
                            Using this mixed-methods approach, I have a paper under revision for <strong>CSCW 2025</strong> 
                            that examines Slack's perceived impact on key interpersonal constructs in teams, 
                            and proposes design examples to better support these constructs in remote and hybrid innovation teams.
                            Most recently, I have been investigating transformational leadership theory in hybrid teams, 
                            across their in-person, video, and text communication. <strong>I am preparing submissions for CSCW 2026 
                                and <a href="https://www.xcdsystem.com/eiasm/program/k4ssn6u/index.cfm?pgid=2856">IPDMC 2025</a> 
                                on this work.</strong>

                        <p>My MASc is supported by the National Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Canada Graduate Scholarship. 
                            I have also been awarded NSERC's Michael Smith Foreign Study Supplement, to fund a future visiting studentship with <a href="https://cmccomb.com/">Dr. Chris McComb</a>, Director of the <a href="https://engineering.cmu.edu/human-ai-design/index.html">Human-AI Design Initiative</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. 
                            I was also a Technical Program Manager at Intel Corporation for 12 months, leading activities in Engineering, Marketing, and Product for their <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/platforms/open-fpga-stack.html">Open FPGA Stack (OFS)</a> and <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/development-tools/fpga-ai-suite.html">Intel FPGA AI Suite</a> programs. 
                            My recent professional experience also includes teaching assistantships in MIE370: Introduction to Machine Learning, and MIE334: Numerical Methods in Engineering. </p>
                        <p>
                            I hold a Bachelor of Applied Science in Industrial Engineering from the University of Toronto, and was awarded the W.S. Wilson Medal for Industrial Engineering in June 2024 for <a href="https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/news/award-winners-2023-2024/">graduating top of my class</a>. 
                            My undergraduate thesis was published in the proceedings of the 2024 American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Conference, for which I conducted an interview study on what motivates students from underrepresented backgrounds in Computer Science to persist in the field.
